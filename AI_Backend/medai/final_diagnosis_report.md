# Final Medical Report: Suspected Foodborne Gastroenteritis

**Patient:** Redacted **Date:** September 05, 2025 **Presenting Complaint:** Abdominal cramps, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and fever.

## Summary of Symptoms

The patient presents with acute onset of abdominal cramps, watery diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting, accompanied by a fever. These symptoms began approximately 36 hours prior to presentation and are rated as follows: diarrhea 7/10, abdominal pain 6/10, and nausea 6/10. The patient reports eating at a seafood restaurant two days before the onset of symptoms. Their sister is experiencing similar symptoms. The patient has no known medical history.

## Differential Diagnosis

| Condition                                                       | Likelihood Score | Rationale                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Foodborne illness (e.g., Norovirus, _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_)  | 8                | Symptoms, recent seafood consumption, and similar symptoms in a family member suggest a foodborne illness. Norovirus and _Vibrio_ species are common causes of gastroenteritis linked to seafood. |
| Viral gastroenteritis (e.g., Rotavirus, Norwalk virus)          | 7                | Viral gastroenteritis is a common cause of similar symptoms and can be transmitted within families. The sudden onset and severity are consistent with this diagnosis.                             |
| Bacterial gastroenteritis (e.g., _Salmonella_, _Campylobacter_) | 6                | While less likely given the seafood consumption, bacterial gastroenteritis can present with these symptoms. Further investigation (stool culture) is needed to confirm.                           |
| Food poisoning (toxin-mediated, e.g., Scombroid, Ciguatera)     | 5                | Possible given the seafood consumption, but the symptoms are more suggestive of infectious gastroenteritis.                                                                                       |

## Evidence and Citations

- **Norovirus:** Norovirus is a highly contagious virus and a common cause of foodborne illness, often associated with seafood consumption. (CDC. Norovirus. [https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/about/transmission.html](https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/about/transmission.html))
- **Vibrio parahaemolyticus:** This bacteria is frequently found in raw or undercooked seafood and can cause gastroenteritis characterized by watery diarrhea, abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, and fever.

## Guideline Compliance

The findings align with general guidelines for managing acute gastroenteritis, focusing on supportive care, rehydration, and identification of the causative agent when necessary (e.g., CDC guidelines for Norovirus).

## Contraindications

None identified based on the information provided.

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Stool Culture:** To identify the specific pathogen causing the gastroenteritis.
2. **Rehydration Therapy:** Oral rehydration solutions are recommended to address fluid and electrolyte loss due to vomiting and diarrhea.
3. **Symptomatic Management:** Administer antiemetics for nausea and vomiting, and antipyretics for fever management as needed.
4. **Dietary Recommendations:** Advise the patient to consume bland foods and avoid dairy products, fatty foods, and caffeine until symptoms subside.
5. **Follow-up:** Schedule a follow-up appointment to monitor symptom resolution and discuss further management if necessary. If symptoms worsen or persist beyond a few days, consider further investigation for other causes.
6. **Public Health Reporting:** If a specific pathogen like _Vibrio_ or _Salmonella_ is identified, report the case to the local health department. Also, advise the patient to inform close contacts, particularly family members experiencing similar symptoms, to seek medical evaluation.
