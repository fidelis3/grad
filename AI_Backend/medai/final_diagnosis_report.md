# Final Medical Report: Elevated Blood Pressure

**Patient:** 55-year-old male

**Date:** October 26, 2024

**Presenting Complaint:** Severely elevated blood pressure (185/115 mmHg) detected during a routine check-up.

**Summary of Symptoms:** The patient reports feeling generally well, denying headaches, dizziness, or other symptoms typically associated with hypertension. He expresses anxiety regarding the high blood pressure reading.

**Medical History:**  Family history of hypertension. Not currently on any medications.  No known allergies reported. (Assumption: Lack of explicit mention of allergies and other medical conditions is interpreted as absence.)

**Differential Diagnosis:**

1. **Essential (Primary) Hypertension:** This is the most likely diagnosis given the patient's age, severely elevated blood pressure (185/115 mmHg), and family history of hypertension. The absence of other symptoms further supports this diagnosis. [NICE guideline on hypertension in adults (NG136), Last updated: 21 November 2023](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng136)

2. **Secondary Hypertension:** While less probable due to the lack of specific symptoms, secondary hypertension must be considered given the severity of the blood pressure elevation. Further investigation is warranted to exclude underlying causes such as renal artery stenosis or adrenal disorders.

3. **White Coat Hypertension:** The patient's anxiety about the high reading raises the possibility of white coat hypertension. However, the severity of the hypertension makes it less likely to be the sole cause. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) is recommended to confirm this.

4. **Anxiety-Induced Hypertension:** Though the patient's anxiety is noted, it is more likely a reaction to the high blood pressure rather than the primary cause. The severity makes it improbable to be solely anxiety-induced.  [NICE guideline on hypertension in adults (NG136), Last updated: 21 November 2023](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng136)



**Guideline Compliance:** The diagnostic approach and initial considerations align with the NICE guideline on hypertension in adults (NG136).

**Contraindications:** None known based on the information provided.

**Next Steps:**

1. **Further Investigation:**  
    * **Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM):** To differentiate between sustained and white coat hypertension.
    * **Laboratory Tests:** Basic metabolic panel, lipid profile, urinalysis, and possibly renal function tests to assess for end-organ damage and screen for secondary causes.

2. **Lifestyle Modifications:**
    * **Dietary Changes:**  Adopt a DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet, low in sodium and rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
    * **Exercise:**  Regular physical activity (at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week).
    * **Weight Management:**  If overweight or obese, weight loss is recommended.
    * **Stress Management Techniques:** Explore relaxation techniques such as deep breathing or meditation to manage anxiety.

3. **Pharmacological Intervention:**  Initiation of antihypertensive medication will likely be necessary given the severity of the hypertension.  Specific medication choice will depend on further investigation results and individual patient factors.
