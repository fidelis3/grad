# Final Medical Report: Persistent Hypertension and Associated Complications
**Patient:** [Insert Patient Name]  
**Date:** 2025-09-06  
**Presenting Complaint:** Persistent morning headaches, blurred vision, shortness of breath with mild exertion, occasional nosebleeds, dizziness upon standing, lower leg swelling in the evening, and fatigue.

## Summary of Symptoms
The patient presents with a three-week history of multiple symptoms including persistent morning headaches, blurred vision, and shortness of breath following mild exertion. They also report occasional nosebleeds, dizziness when standing, evening swelling in the lower legs, and fatigue despite adequate sleep. Symptoms are moderate to severe, markedly affecting daily activities. Notably, the patient has a history of smoking, a sedentary lifestyle, a family history of hypertension and cardiovascular disease, and has consistently recorded blood pressure readings exceeding 160/95 mmHg. Laboratory results indicate borderline proteinuria and elevated creatinine levels.

## Differential Diagnosis
| Condition                          | Likelihood Score | Rationale                                                                                                                                                        |
|------------------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Hypertensive Crisis                | 9                 | Consistent blood pressure levels above 160/95 mmHg and symptoms such as headaches, blurred vision, and nosebleeds are indicative of a hypertensive crisis.    |
| Chronic Kidney Disease              | 8                 | Elevated creatinine and borderline proteinuria suggest kidney dysfunction potentially resulting from prolonged uncontrolled hypertension.                      |
| Cardiac Disease (e.g., Heart Failure) | 7                 | Shortness of breath on exertion, lower leg edema, and fatigue, along with a family history of cardiovascular issues, indicate potential cardiac involvement.   |
| Orthostatic Hypotension            | 6                 | Dizziness upon standing could suggest orthostatic hypotension, possibly linked to antihypertensive medications or autonomic dysfunction.                       |

## Evidence and Citations
- Hypertensive crisis management requires adherence to methods and thresholds as indicated by NICE guidelines [NICE NG136 (2025)].
- Challenges remain in treating resistant hypertension which may accompany severe cases [NICE NG136 (2025)].
- Guidelines emphasize the need for same-day specialist assessment for patients presenting with extreme hypertension or emergency symptoms [NICE NG136 (2025)].
- Recommendations for investigations to uncover potential chronic kidney disease increase in patients showing target organ damage, with links to hypertension management [NICE NG136 (2025)].
- New recommendations emphasize investigating for target organ damage in patients with acute cardiovascular symptoms [NICE NG136 (2025)].

## Guideline Compliance
- Compliance with NICE NG136 (2025) is assessed as aligned regarding the diagnosis and management of hypertensive crises and chronic kidney disease, emphasizing the importance of investigational follow-ups for potential organ damage. The management recommendations align with findings regarding blood pressure control methods, thresholds for emergencies, and necessary referral protocols.

## Contraindications
- **Aggressive blood pressure lowering in the presence of orthostatic hypotension:** Rapid or excessive reduction in blood pressure could exacerbate dizziness upon standing, increasing the risk of falls and complications.

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Schedule an immediate referral for a specialist assessment due to symptomatic hypertensive crisis.
2. Conduct an ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) to confirm hypertension diagnosis and assess blood pressure fluctuations throughout the day.
3. Order additional laboratory tests to evaluate kidney function, including a comprehensive metabolic panel and protein-to-creatinine ratio.
4. Assess for signs of potential heart failure through an echocardiogram and determine the need for a cardiac consultation.
5. Review medications currently prescribed, especially antihypertensives, to address the risk of orthostatic hypotension.
6. Implement lifestyle modification suggestions aimed at smoking cessation and increased physical activity to support overall cardiovascular health.
