# Final Medical Report: Suspected Malaria Infection  
**Patient:** [Insert Patient Name]  
**Date:** 2025-09-11  
**Presenting Complaint:** Fever, chills, headache, vomiting  

## Summary of Symptoms  
The patient presents with fever, chills, headache, and vomiting, all with a severity rating of 9/10. Symptoms have persisted for two days, accompanied by intermittent sweating and fatigue. Notably, the patient has recently traveled to a malaria-endemic area.  

## Differential Diagnosis  

1. **Malaria**  
   - Likelihood Score: 9  
   - Rationale: High symptom severity combined with recent travel to a malaria-endemic region strongly suggests malaria as the primary diagnosis.

2. **Dengue Fever**  
   - Likelihood Score: 7  
   - Rationale: Despite overlapping symptoms like headache and fever, dengue is less suspected due to the higher likelihood of malaria under the current travel circumstances.

3. **Typhoid Fever**  
   - Likelihood Score: 6  
   - Rationale: Fever, headache, and fatigue align with typhoid fever, but are less specific without abdominal pain, common in typhoid.

4. **Viral Gastroenteritis**  
   - Likelihood Score: 4  
   - Rationale: While vomiting aligns, high fever severity and chills are more indicative of another condition.

5. **Influenza**  
   - Likelihood Score: 3  
   - Rationale: Less likely given the recent travel history predominating the malaria-endemic area.

## Guideline Compliance  
According to WHO guidelines, malaria should be diagnosed using blood sample testing through microscopy or rapid diagnostic testing (RDT). The patient, having visited a malaria-endemic region, should immediately undergo these specific tests to confirm the presence of the Plasmodium parasite. This approach aligns with the policy of "test, treat, and track" to ensure effective management and mitigate unnecessary antimalarial drug use.  

## Contraindications  
No contraindications have been identified at this stage. Treatment will be adjusted based on the confirmed diagnosis and patient history.

## Recommended Next Steps  
1. Perform a Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) for malaria to confirm the diagnosis.  
2. Conduct additional testing to exclude other potential infections like dengue or typhoid if malaria is ruled out.  
3. Begin treatment following WHO guidelines for malaria, once confirmed, tailored to the patient's specific regional sensitivities and personal medical history.  
4. Monitor symptoms closely and adjust treatment based on laboratory and clinical findings.  
5. Educate the patient about the signs and symptoms that would necessitate a return to the clinic for further assessment.
