# Final Medical Report: Persistent Hypertension with Target Organ Damage
**Patient:** [Insert Patient Name]
**Date:** 2025-09-06
**Presenting Complaint:** Persistent morning headaches, blurred vision, shortness of breath, occasional nosebleeds, dizziness, leg swelling in the evening, and fatigue

## Summary of Symptoms
The patient, with a history of smoking and sedentary lifestyle, presents with a three-week history of symptoms including persistent morning headaches, blurred vision, shortness of breath on mild exertion, occasional nosebleeds, dizziness upon standing, lower leg swelling in the evening, and fatigue despite adequate sleep. There is a significant family history of hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Physical examination shows consistently elevated blood pressure readings above 160/95 mmHg. Laboratory tests reveal borderline proteinuria and elevated creatinine, indicating possible renal involvement.

## Differential Diagnosis
1. **Hypertension with End Organ Damage**
   - **Likelihood Score:** 10
   - **Rationale:** Elevated blood pressure readings, morning headaches, blurred vision, and signs of renal involvement suggest hypertension with end organ damage.
  
2. **Chronic Kidney Disease**
   - **Likelihood Score:** 8
   - **Rationale:** Presence of borderline proteinuria and elevated creatinine levels suggest possible chronic kidney damage, likely secondary to hypertension.
  
3. **Hypertensive Heart Disease**
   - **Likelihood Score:** 7
   - **Rationale:** Family history of cardiovascular disease, shortness of breath, and leg swelling point towards potential hypertensive heart disease.
  
4. **Smoking-related Cardiovascular Risk**
   - **Likelihood Score:** 6
   - **Rationale:** History of smoking contributes to elevated cardiovascular risk, exacerbating the effects of hypertension.

## Evidence and Citations
- Investigations for organ damage related to hypertension must be conducted as per the NICE guideline (NICE guideline on hypertension in adults NG136, 2025).
- Establishing blood pressure targets in chronic kidney disease management is crucial (NICE guideline on chronic kidney disease CG182, 2014).
- Smoking cessation is vital to managing cardiovascular risk (NICE guideline on hypertension in adults NG136, 2011).
  
## Guideline Compliance
- **Hypertension with End Organ Damage:** Compliance with the guideline is achieved by adhering to recommendations on investigating organ damage and confirming hypertension when no other cause is identified (aligned with NICE NG136, 2025).
- **Chronic Kidney Disease:** Assessment of CKD aligns with recommendations using eGFR and ACR for individuals at risk (NICE CG182, 2014 & NG136, 2025).
- **Hypertensive Heart Disease:** Recognition of hypertension as a risk factor is consistent with guideline criteria (NICE NG136, 2025).
- **Smoking-related Cardiovascular Risk:** Smoking cessation and cost-effectiveness of antihypertensive treatment align with patient management (NICE NG136, 2011, 2019).

## Contraindications
No contraindications were identified regarding the proposed management strategies.

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Initiate antihypertensive treatment and monitor blood pressure closely, considering home or ambulatory monitoring to confirm hypertension.
2. Conduct further investigations to assess the extent of organ damage, particularly renal and cardiac evaluations.
3. Implement lifestyle modifications, including smoking cessation and physical activity recommendations.
4. Follow up with nephrology and cardiology consultations for specialized management if chronic kidney disease or hypertensive heart disease is confirmed.
5. Schedule regular review of treatment efficacy and adjust management plans based on clinical and laboratory evaluations.
