# Final Medical Report: Possible Essential Hypertension and Associated Disorders
**Patient:** John Doe  
**Date:** September 06, 2025  
**Presenting Complaint:** Persistent headaches, blurred vision, shortness of breath, chest tightness, dizziness, nosebleeds, and leg swelling.

## Summary of Symptoms
The patient presents with persistent morning headaches, episodes of blurred vision during screen use or reading, shortness of breath upon mild exertion, and chest tightness described as pressure rather than sharp pain. Additionally, the patient experiences dizziness upon standing quickly, occasional nosebleeds without preceding trauma, and swelling in the lower legs by evening. These symptoms have persisted for two weeks and are rated by the patient as a severity of 10. The patient's medical history includes smoking and a sedentary lifestyle, along with a family history of cardiovascular disease. Recent lab results indicate elevated creatinine levels and borderline proteinuria.

## Differential Diagnosis
1. **Hypertension**  
   - **Likelihood Score:** 9  
   - **Rationale:** The presence of morning headaches, blurred vision, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and dizziness upon standing suggests hypertension, especially given the patient's smoking history, sedentary lifestyle, and family history of cardiovascular disease.

2. **Chronic Kidney Disease**  
   - **Likelihood Score:** 8  
   - **Rationale:** Elevated creatinine and borderline proteinuria, coupled with hypertension symptoms, suggest a potential renal issue possibly related to chronic kidney disease.

3. **Heart Failure**  
   - **Likelihood Score:** 7  
   - **Rationale:** Symptoms such as swelling in the lower legs, shortness of breath, and chest tightness could indicate fluid buildup and heart issues, exacerbated by a sedentary lifestyle and familial cardiovascular risks.

4. **Obstructive Sleep Apnea**  
   - **Likelihood Score:** 6  
   - **Rationale:** Morning headaches and a sedentary lifestyle are consistent with obstructive sleep apnea, which can contribute to nocturnal hypoxia and cardiovascular strain.

5. **Secondary Hypertension (Renal or Endocrine Disorder)**  
   - **Likelihood Score:** 5  
   - **Rationale:** Elevated creatinine levels suggest examining potential secondary causes like renal artery stenosis or endocrine disorders affecting blood pressure.

## Evidence and Citations
- **Hypertension:**  
  - Severe hypertension is indicated by a systolic blood pressure of 180 mmHg or higher and/or diastolic of 120 mmHg or higher (NICE NG136, 2025).
  - Confirmation of hypertension by ABPM is essential for blood pressures 140/90 mmHg or greater before treatment initiation (NICE NG136, 2025).

- **Chronic Kidney Disease:**  
  - Individuals with high creatinine or albumin levels require lower blood pressure targets (NICE NG136, 2025).
  - Investigations for CKD should be considered if target organ damage is disproportionate to hypertension severity (NICE NG136, 2025).

- **Heart Failure:**  
  - Initial antihypertensive treatment with ACE inhibitors or ARBs is advised (NICE NG136, 2025).

- **Obstructive Sleep Apnea:**  
  - Investigation for target organ damage is recommended while confirmation for hypertension is pending (NICE NG136, 2025).

- **Secondary Hypertension:**  
  - Investigations for secondary causes like renal or endocrine issues should be considered if conditions present before age 30 or are treatment-resistant (NICE NG136, 2025).

## Guideline Compliance
- **Essential Hypertension:** Aligned with NICE NG136 (2025), guidelines provide updated directions for hypertension diagnosis and management.
- **Secondary Hypertension:** Aligned with NICE NG136 (2025), highlighting the significance of investigating secondary causes.
- **White Coat Hypertension:** Aligned with NICE guidelines, advocating for ABPM to confirm hypertension diagnosis.
- **Anxiety-Induced Hypertension:** Not aligned, as NICE NG136 does not recommend relaxation therapies for primary hypertension management.

## Contraindications
None identified based on the provided data.

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Perform ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) to confirm hypertension diagnosis.
2. Conduct further investigations to assess renal function and rule out chronic kidney disease.
3. Evaluate cardiac function to consider potential heart failure.
4. Screen for obstructive sleep apnea due to associated risk factors and symptoms.
5. Consider lifestyle modifications aimed at reducing cardiovascular risk factors, including smoking cessation and increased physical activity.
6. Follow-up consultations for comprehensive management planning based on confirmed diagnoses.
