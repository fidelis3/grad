    "result": "# Final Medical Report: Multi-Symptom Presentation with Recurrent Fever and Pain\n\n**Patient:** [Insert Patient Name]\n**Date:** September 06, 2025\n**Presenting Complaint:** Fever, nose blockage, severe chest and back pains, and an allergic-type rash persisting for nine days.\n\n## Summary of Symptoms\n\nThe patient presents with a nine-day history of fever, nasal congestion, severe chest and back pain, and an allergic-type rash.  The patient reports that the severe pain episodes are recurrent, lasting for a few hours at a time, consistent with their medical history.  The patient's visit to a local butcher shop a few hours prior to symptom onset may be relevant.\n\n## Differential Diagnosis\n\n| Condition                       | Likelihood Score | Rationale                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n|---------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Adult-Onset Still's Disease    | 7               | Fever, rash, and severe pain are characteristic of Still's disease. The recurrent nature of the pain and fever also aligns with this diagnosis. The nine-day duration suggests a more persistent condition. |\n| Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) | 6               | SLE can manifest with fever, rash, joint pain (which could be perceived as back and chest pain), and fatigue.  The nine-day duration and history of similar episodes support this possibility.          |\n| Allergic Reaction              | 5               | The \"allergic-type rash\" and nose blockage suggest an allergic reaction, potentially related to the butcher shop visit. However, severe chest and back pain are atypical unless a secondary infection exists. |\n| Infection (viral or bacterial)   | 5               | Fever, body aches, and rash are common in various infections. The nine-day duration suggests persistence, but recurring severe pain and fever are less typical.                                        |\n| Brucellosis                     | 4               | Given the butcher shop visit, exposure to brucellosis is possible. Symptoms include fever, chills, sweats, fatigue, and muscle pain. However, the rash and nasal congestion are less typical.                 |\n\n\n## Evidence and Citations\n\nNo specific research was conducted regarding the primary diagnosis, and therefore, no citations are available at this time. Further investigation is required.\n\n## Guideline Compliance\n\nNo specific clinical guidelines were provided for comparison.  Adherence to relevant guidelines will be assessed following a confirmed diagnosis.\n\n## Contraindications\n\nNo specific contraindications have been identified at this time.\n\n## Recommended Next Steps\n\n1. **Complete Blood Count (CBC):** To assess for signs of infection or inflammation.\n2. **Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP):** To evaluate organ function and electrolyte balance.\n3. **C-Reactive Protein (CRP) and Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR):** To measure inflammation levels.\n4. **Allergy Testing:** To identify potential allergens contributing to the rash and nasal congestion.\n5. **Chest X-Ray:** To evaluate for pulmonary causes of chest pain and difficulty breathing.\n6. **Blood Cultures:** To rule out bacterial infections, including brucellosis.\n7. **Rheumatologic Consultation:** If Still's disease or SLE remains a strong diagnostic possibility.\n8. **Infectious Disease Consultation:** If an infectious etiology is suspected.\n9. **Thorough History and Physical Examination:**  Including detailed questions about the nature of the pain, the rash, and the patientâ€™s activities leading up to the onset of symptoms.\n10. **Monitor and Document Symptom Progression:**  Closely track the patient's symptoms over time to help refine the diagnosis."
