## Understanding Your Symptoms

You are experiencing swollen, teary eyes, which can be uncomfortable and concerning.  This can be caused by a variety of factors, and it's important to identify the cause to get appropriate relief.

## What This Might Mean

* **Allergic reactions:**  Exposure to allergens like pollen, pet dander, or dust mites can trigger an immune response, leading to eye irritation, swelling, and tearing.
* **Infections:**  Viral or bacterial infections can cause inflammation and swelling in the eyes, often accompanied by redness and discharge.
* **Irritants:**  Exposure to irritants like smoke, dust, or chemicals can irritate the eyes, causing them to swell and tear up.
* **Other causes:**  Less common causes can include underlying medical conditions or blockages in the tear ducts.

## Recommended Next Step

It is recommended to schedule an appointment with a doctor or eye specialist (ophthalmologist) to determine the cause of your symptoms and receive appropriate treatment. In the meantime, try to avoid rubbing your eyes and consider using over-the-counter lubricating eye drops to help soothe any discomfort. If your symptoms worsen significantly or you experience any vision changes, seek immediate medical attention.
